Dating from the time of the Roman Empire, archaeolosts have uncovered a giant multi-story palace and an imposing fortress built around the hill, with walls as thick as 2.8 m. Temples and quarters of residential buildings were also constructed in the fortress. The mgalithic complex had been laid in ruins and rearected many times in history.</p>
<p class="text-left">The earliest traces of human activity are from the late Stone-Copper Age (Chalcolithic) at the end of the fourth century BC, when people began to worship and bring gifts to the Rock (so-called megalithic culture). Some of the unique items that have been found, such as fregments of cult tables, were made of clay. Parts of idols, a and bowl in the form of a partidge, were also among the finds. Apparently, hallucinatory drugs for the priests were stored in bowls such as this. From the Chalcolithic period, there are several great knives formed out of flint, one of which is 20 cm long. Experts say this material can only be found in modern northeastern  Bulgaria, where it was introduced as an expensive commodity. It may have been exchanged for gold nuggest, in which the Eastern Rhodopes are rich.</p>
<p class="text-left">The development of the rock complex continued during the Bronze and Iron Age. There is solid evidence it was during the Lat Bronze Age(16th - 11th century BC) when Perperikon experiencesd its first big boom. This is the era of the Crete-Mycenaean civilization</p>

When volcanic activity started, the forest was buried and burned by the hot lava. The high temperatures carbonized whole trees or parts of them. During the later stages of volcanic activity through these skeletons flowed waters carrying flint substance and filled the cavities thus forming fossilized trees. There are fallen, buried or broken petrified trees around the world but what is unique about the Petrified Forest near the village of Raven is that the trees are standing.</p>');

underwater volcanic activity dating back to the Paleogene. After the sea retreated and the sea bottom rose up, erosion began. The lower pink layer turned out to be softer and more easily succumbed to the effects of sun, wind and rain. The upper green layer contained strong minerals, mostly volcanic glass and took more time to
weather. So it took thousands of years to shape this wonderful combination of unique shapes and colors.</p>');
